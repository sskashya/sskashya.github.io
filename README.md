### Bio
I am currently volunteering as the Advisory Director of Data and Operations at Yoga 4 The World, 501 (c)(3). This non-profit organization aims to provide accessible and equitable yoga and meditation practices to everyone, everywhere. We serve kids, senior citizens, individuals with a history of substance abuse and trauma, and individuals with chronic disease such as Parkinson's disease. My current services are an expansion of my previous role as Data Engineering Analyst, where I recognized redundancies and bottlenecks from a lack of healthy data practices. Establishing data governance and standards, allowed me to then further automate the operations of the organizations through data (ETL) pipelines and AI tools, and communicate data reports via visualizations on dashboards effectively. My roles as Advisory Director of Data and Operations expands into DNS server authentication, improved server capacity for deployments, and building out the data team for further analytics (Google Analytics, A/B Testing for MMMs, etc).

I recently graduated from Syracuse University with a Master's degree in Data Science. For my electives, I opted to concentrate in Data Pipelines and Platforms. During my Masters program, I worked with a PhD student to publish a Machine Learning methodology that aims to redesign healthcare screening for at-risk adolescent tobacco consumption. In our manuscript, we give a special mention to Dr. Joshua Introne for his initial involvement and guidance. My research and formal analysis leverages creative pre-processing techniques, machine learning ensemble algorithms, and SHAP (probability theory) to find correlations between behavioral and environemental features, and tobacco consumption among American adolescents. Furthermore, it aims to create a better understanding of the complex relationship between adolescents and tobacco, while reducing the need for self-reporting. This was accepted to IOP's Machine Learning: Health series on April 29, 2025. 

Before my Master's at Syracuse University, I worked as a Manufacturing Process Engineer at Indium Corporation. You can read more about my responsibilities under the work experience section. As a Manufacturing Process Engineer, my responsibilities were a mixture of data analysis and design analysis for continuous improvement projects. Additionally, over time, I was also tasked with managing and leading cross-functional teams on NPI projects. 

And before my experience as a Manufacturing Process Engineer, I received a Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering from Kettering University. This small engineering university in Flint, MI provided me with opportunities to lead student clubs and give back to the Flint community.
